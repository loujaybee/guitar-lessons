## Diatonic in G

1. Ionian - G Major 7
2. Dorian - A minor 7/13
    - Adding in the 13th adds in the "Dorian" note
3. Phyrigian - Flat 9
    - "Technically cheating" as has an extra note outside of G Major
4. Lydian - C Major 7 Sharp 11
    - When ever you hear sharp 11 think "Lydian"
5. Mixolydian - D Dominant 7
    - Add in some chromaticism
6. Aeolian - Minor 7
7. Locrian - Minor 7 Flat 5 (or "half diminished")

Questions:
- How do you remember the associated chords with the modes? Just from mathematically working out the intervals?
- Why chromatic for mixolydian?
- It's funny how these chords are starting to sound more normal...
