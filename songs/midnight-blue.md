# Midnight Blue Improv Tips

1. Find the key centre (ideas that start and finish on F)
2. Space (allow lots of space between ideas - don’t fill all silence)
3. Pacing (approach things slow + fast)
4. Ignore mistakes, play through bum notes, use chromatism.
5. Use your ears (determine time, spacing, dynamics)
